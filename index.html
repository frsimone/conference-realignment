      <h1>The SEC and Big 10 are Becoming Super-Conferences</h1>

      <p>College athletics are steeped in tradition. The bands, the student sections, the atmosphere and so many more elements make up, what many would consider, the soul of college sports. One of those is the geographic nature of college sports.</p>

      <p>For decades, conferences have been based on geography, which has created fierce rivalries. Duke and North Carolina fighting for ACC titles in basketball, Michigan and Ohio State battling on the football field in the Big 10, Syracuse and Georgetown in the old days of Big East basketball. The loss goes on.</p>

      <p>However, that all seems like it’s being left behind, in part due to conference realignment. It’s not a new phenomenon. The Syracuse-Georgetown rivalry isn’t what it used to be, largely due to the collapse and subsequent rebirth of the Big East in the early-to-mid 2010s, without historic staples like SU, Pitt, Boston College and West Virginia.</p>

      <p>Other examples from the past decade and a half include Texas A&M and Missouri leaving the Big 12 for the SEC, and Nebraska fleeing to the Big 10. At that point, it was a trickle, now it’s a wave.</p>

      <p>Within the last two years, Texas and Oklahoma have announced their intentions to move from the Bog 12 to the SEC. USC and UCLA, both located in Los Angeles, have decided to leave the PAC 12 for the midwest-based Big 10.</p>

      <p>That seems to be the way the wind is blowing. Schools are leaving the Big 12 and PAC 12, which are considered Power 5 conferences, meaning it is the highest level of competition in the NCAA, for other Power 5 conferences (the SEC and the Big 10).</p>

      <div class="col-md-5">

      <p>What’s the reason behind these changes in the paradigm of college athletics? As far as ESPN Syracuse analyst Brent Axe is concerned, it’s simple.</p>

      <p>“Money,” Axe bluntly stated.</p>

      <p>In 2021, there were two conferences that generated over a billion dollars in revenue: the SEC at nearly $1.8 billion and the Big 10 at nearly $1.2 billion. The ACC finished a distant third, with the Big 12 and PAC 12 at the bottom of the list.</p>

      <p>In 2020, the SEC finalized a deal with Disney to move its marquee Saturday afternoon football game from CBS to ABC for $300 million per year.</p>

      <p>It takes effect in 2024, and synchronizes the conference’s media rights timeline, allowing it to negotiate its entire broadcast package in 2034.</p>

      <p>The SEC projects this influx of money will raise member schools’ payout from the conference from $55 million to as high as $70 million per year.</p> 

      <p>The Big 10, meanwhile, did just that in August. The conference will receive $8 billion over seven seasons from CBS, Fox and NBC beginning in 2023. Schools will receive $57 million from the Big 10 this year, and, while that number is expected to rise thanks to the new media rights package, there are no public projections as to what it will rise to.</p>

       <p>According to Axe, this all stems from football popularity. The highest rated game of the 2022 season, so far, is Michigan vs. Ohio State in week 13 which had 17.1 million viewers on Fox. For comparison’s sake, the NBA Finals averaged 12.4 million viewers and the World Series averaged 11.8 million this year, both significantly lower than college football’s regular season peak.</p>

       <p>Men’s basketball is the second-highest rated college sport, and even it pales in comparison to football. In the 2021-22 season, CBS averaged 1.3 million viewers on its men’s basketball broadcasts. That number jumped to seven million for CBS’s football telecasts.</p>

       <p>As Axe puts it, “everybody else is fighting for second place.”</p>

       <p>The amount of money spent on football shows it. In 2021, SEC schools spent a combined $479 million in expenses surrounding their football programs, the most out of any conference. The Big 10 was second with $373 million. Those two put together ($852 million) outspent the other three Power 5 conferences combined. The ACC, Big 12 and PAC 12 totaled $660 million in football expenses.</p>

      <p>So, it’s no wonder why schools want to join the SEC and Big 10. The profits are there to be had, and they are only increasing as new TV contracts take effect. Axe says this isn’t some kind of trend that is destined to eventually swing back in the opposite direction.</p>  

      <p>He believes there is too much money at stake for institutions to not go down this route. There is also the fear of being left behind. If a school doesn’t join a conference that will be part of the “Power (insert number here)” in the future, the prospects of being competitive and generating revenue are dim.</p>

      <p>Axe thinks college athletics will be unrecognizable in 15 years because of the level of commercialization there will be if the current pace holds. He even wonders if we’ve already reached that point.</p>
